1. bugfix/InvocationTargetException-in-download-transaction-history
	> InvocationTargetException is thrown when calling endpoint for downloading/exporting Transaction history
	> caused by TransactionService.java (line 235)
		- sheet.autoSizeColumn(i+1);
	> caused by missing fonts in the environment the Spring Boot app is being hosted
		- typical issue in downsized OS environment where in DNTX is deployed
		- since right now, the DNTX backend is deployed in Docker, where the fonts Apache POI is looking for is missing
		- this is also the reason why I can not replicate the issue in the local dev env, since the fonts are present in my machine
