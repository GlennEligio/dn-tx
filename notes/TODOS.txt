(DONE) DNTX-005: Make the delete Transaction seemless
 > as of now, the user needs to close the modal, then go back to the Transaction list to see the effect
 
DNTX-006: Use OAuth for Gdrive
 > as of now, if user uses the gdrive as cloud storage for files, they need to create a link that is accessible to everyone and add it in the log
 > this creates security issue with regards to gdrive files
 > to solve this, we will need to use OAuth to authorize DNTX to access Gdrive of the user
 
(DONE) DNTX-007: Forgot password using email
 > user must be able to reset their password using thewir email
 > dntx will send an email with link
 
(DONE) DNTX-008: Add "Re-enter password" field in Register form

(DONE) DNTX-011: Add option for entering transaction date in the create Transaction feature

(DONE) DNTX-012: Use ZonedDateTime instead of LocalDateTime for time related information of Transactions

	- input for date in creating/editing Transaction
		-> backend and frontend

(DONE) DNTX-013: Inject Okteto Secret for sensitive data. Modify k8s yaml for better decoupling of components

(DONE) DNTX-014: Transaction field member for indicating reverse transaction type
 > used for changing current transaction type in reverse
	- ex: CC2GOLD to GOLD2CC
	- this means that instead of the User trading their CC to Gold, they trade their Gold for CC
	
(DONE) DNTX-015: TransactionItem class
 > as of now, each Transaction can only represent a single item in the said Transaction
	- for Transaction with multiple items (i.e. ITEM2GOLD, where there are multiple items in a single Transaction), we will need to create multiple Transaction objects
 > to remedy this, for each Transaction, there will be multiple transaction items
 > TransactionItem class will have the same attribute fields as the current Transaction class right now
 > Then the Transaction class will have a field of TransactionItems[], to reference multiple TransactionItem
 > this change will affect the following places
	a. Backend
		1. "model" classes
			- Transaction
			- TransactionItem
		2. services
			- TransactionService
				= excelToList
				= listToExcel
	b. Frontend
		1. Transaction details
		2. Create/Edit/Delete Transaction page
		3. Transaction Card, specify the number of Transaction items
